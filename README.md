# Learning Management System (LMS) Project
Hello!
This is a Learning Management System (LMS) developed for my frontend training startup. I built this full-stack application entirely on my own, focusing on modern web technologies to ensure a seamless user experience.

Technologies Used:
Front-end:
 React.js,
 Form handling with Formik,
 Validation with Yup,
 Routing with React Router,
 API requests with Axios,
 State management with Context API,
 Styling with SCSS,
 HTML for structuring content,

Back-end:
 Node.js with Express for server-side logic,
 Nodemailer for sending emails,
 PostgreSQL as the database,

 Others: Git, Vercel, RestAPI
 
This LMS provides a robust and scalable platform for delivering educational content and managing student progress effectively.
